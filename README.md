This app is created using Python programming language. You can differentiate any function once, twice, or multiple times. You must note the differential installments in front of the Order. You should specify the variable according to the function you are using (e.g.:- If f(x)=2x then the variable is x, If g(y)=y^3+2y+1 then the variable is y). "**" should be used if you note a power in an expression or term (e.g.:- x^3+2y+1 should be written as x**3+2x+1 in the function column.
